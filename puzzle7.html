				Some memes are so versatile, you can use them on posts that people take to their Facebook wall to write. Well, these memes aren't exact soundalikes, but they're close enough to be funny.

				<br><br>
				Well, I met my favorite actress the other day, but I'm afraid Ms. Loren was acting a little kooky. She kept checking me for hidden earpieces and listening devicesâ€”I think she thought I was some kind of a spy or government xxxx. Xx Xxxxxx xxxx? Xxxx opinion matters, dear reader, so comment below to settle the debate on if she's doing all right mentally. <br><br>
				Okay, everyone. I'm tired of having this argument on my wall, so let me clear things up once and for all: BLT's are the best sandwich out there. I double-dog xxxx xxx xxx xxx cheese lovers (every single one of you!) to argue this: why have one lousy meat and some cheese, when you can have a superior meat, crisp vegetables, and maybe even some mayo? <br><br>
				Well! Do NOT call customer service for hot dog companies when you're trying to get simple answers! I just wanted to know how long to grill a normal hot dog, and the customer service agents were nothing but curt with me! It's like they were having an Oscar Xxxxx xxxx-xxx, to see who can be the most impolite! <br><br>
				Not a lot of the things rub me the wrong way, but the Enigmarch prompts really find a way to xxxxx. "Xxxxx" is such a broad prompt! So many possibilities! What do I do, a puzzle about archery, or about Cupid? <br><br>
				For all the followers who know my habit of sharing my sad encounters with branded waffles, here's yet another tale of Xxxx xxx. Xxxx luck this time, but I bumped into my breakfast plate with my elbow, knocking the waffle straight to the ground. Sad! <br><br>
				Should I get a door in the fence outside my house? On one hand, I'd feel more secure, but on the other hand, I care about my family being free, and I'd hate to xxxx xx xxx xx. <br><br>
				FML... got my Great Xxxx x xxxxxxx of himself made out of pork, lovingly sculpted by a really expensive artist who normally just does woodwork, and the stupid dog ate the whole thing! #PetFail <br><br>
				lol just watched the doctor who episode where donna noble's grandpa goes on an adventure and he's honestly too much like the slightest thing makes Xxxx xxxxx (seriously, he acts completely undomesticated!) <br><br>
				I believe the work of New York Times crossword constructors can be be a bit incorrect at times, and all of them have made mistakes in my book, but I admit I find the crosswords (especially the one on 5/6/21) by Ed Xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx (I don't want to say "most right").
