						I wrote this about the NPL flat type Chop 'N' Swap, which weirdly I can't find on the online guide to the Enigma. Here's the description:<br><br>
						<i>In a chop ‘n’ swap, a letter is removed (chopped) from somewhere in the middle of a word or phrase; the two pieces remaining switch positions (swap). Examples: shame → chop the “a” → swap the parts → mesh; and ta(f)fies</i><br><br>
						Hope that helps! If you're new to flats as a puzzle type, check out <a href="https://enigma.puzzlers.org/guide/arrange#transposal" target="_blank">this page</a> for some examples. An important note is that the poems don't necessarily rhyme/have the same meter after you replace the capitalized words!

<b>ONE (7), TWO (6)</b><br>
Your ONE's got you feeling too sick?<br>
My potion should do just the trick!<br>
And all it'll TWO:<br>
Some money from you.<br>
Once that's in, I'll heal you right quick.<br><br>

<b>TWO WORDS (2 6), ONE WORD (7)</b><br>
Rule one of camp: No sneaking out!<br>
Don't try to leave TWO WORDS.<br>
We're not ONE WORD, we all can tell<br>
When there are trysting nerds.<br><br>

<b>FIRST ONE (2 5), SECOND ONE (4 2)</b><br>
FIRST ONE's stellar writing skills cannot be overstated!<br>
The songs on 80s Ladies" are quite interrelated<br>
Just take a little listen; it'll wow you like a mother<br>
The way you'll find the album's songs all SECOND ONE each other<br><br>

<b>THE LONGER (1 6), SHORT (6)</b><br>
For Catholics with needs for speed,<br>
This little trick will do you nice:<br>
At penance, don't say whole SHORT creeds<br>
A quick "THE LONGER" will suffice!<br><br>

<b>LONGER (7), SHORTER (6)</b><br>
SHORTER Gorman's Buddhist now,<br>
She's found her faith is growing stronger.<br>
Instead of writing poetry,<br>
She's drawing out a giant LONGER.<br><br>

<b>SEVEN (7), SIX (6)</b><br>
Mr. Wilde's a cunning sort; the SEVEN guy in all the town.<br>
His weaknesses: rice, pasta, fries (if it has SIX, he'll scarf it down).<br><br>

<b>ONE (7), TWO (6)</b><br>
"The TWO Del Fuego B&B<br>
Has wrecked my Argentine vacation!<br>
So run down! No way you'll see<br>
A ONE hotel in all the nation!"<br><br>

<b>UNCUT (7), SEVERED (6)</b><br>
Elaine May is a talent who is known throughout the nation!<br>
I don't think making "SEVERED" should UNCUT her reputation.<br><br>

<b>LONGER (7), SHORT (6)</b><br>
Now, neurosurgery's precise.<br>
To do it drunk? There's nothing wronger!<br>
That's why it's bad to have a SHORT<br>
Before you operate on LONGER<br><br>

<b>ONE (5 3), OTHER (2 5)</b><br>
I have a lovely cleaning cloth<br>
With art of Lisa Simpson's brother.<br>
Go, see it on the bathroom's ONE<br>
(He's spraying a graffitied "OTHER").<br><br>

<b>LONG (8), RECUT (7)</b><br>
The Prime LONG's on a farewell tour.<br>
He's pandering to fans of transportation<br>
By visiting all bus RECUT<br>
(You could say they're his final destination)<br><br>

<b>FIRST PART (7), SECOND PART (6)</b><br>
I'm like the boss of tattoo art<br>
(A real FIRST PART of SECOND PART)<br><br>

<b>A (7), B (6)</b><br>
Your room's a mess! What have you done?<br>
There's piles of trash—the odor's terrible!<br>
I hate to A and scold you, son,<br>
But, wow, I find the B unbearable!<br><br>

<b>ONE (7), TWO (6)</b><br>
Your test answer was wrong...way off, at that:<br>
Man of La TWO was not by Carrie ONE Catt.<br><br>

<b>LONG (7), SHORT (6)</b><br>
Walden's great, per my report:<br>
That's why LONG's my favorite SHORT.<br><br>

<b>SEVEN (7), SIX (6)</b><br>
My dealership thrives on affordable cars<br>
You want a Ferrari? I'll say, "No shot!"<br>
But ask me for Nissans? I'll gladly SIX<br>
I'll show you all the SEVEN we got.<br><br>
